# Multivariate-Timeseries-Analysis-with-Stateful-LSTM
This project analyses timeseries dataset with a type of recurrent neural network: LSTM. The stateful parameter is set to true to get finer control over internal states of the LSTM.

The link to access the dataset can be found from the UCL Machine Learning Repository: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption
